# OptimalDiffusion
## Introduction:
This code repository aims to explore how the diffusion coefficient affects the sample generation quality in score-based diffusion models.

## How to run codes:
- 1D Gaussian: one may simply run the jupyter notebook therein.
- mnist:
```
cd mnist # move to the folder
python3 mnist_train.py # train the model
python3 mnist_visualize.py # generate assets
```
